## Overview

Prepare reprexes for posting to [GitHub
issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/), [RStudio Community Forum](https://community.rstudio.com/),
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r), or [Slack
snippets](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204145658-Create-a-snippet).
What is a `reprex`? It’s a **repr**oducible **ex**ample, as coined by
[Romain
Francois](https://twitter.com/romain_francois/status/530011023743655936).

Given R code on the clipboard, selected in RStudio, as an expression
(quoted or not), or in a file …

  - run it via `rmarkdown::render()`,
  - with deliberate choices re: `render()` arguments, knitr options, and
    Pandoc options.

Get resulting runnable code + output as

  - Markdown, suitable for GitHub or Stack Overflow, or as
  - R code, augmented with commented output.

Result is returned invisibly, placed on the clipboard, and written to a
file. Preview an HTML version in RStudio viewer or default browser.

## Installation

Install from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("reprex")
```

or get a development version from GitHub:

``` r
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/reprex")
```

On Linux, you probably want to install
[xclip](https://github.com/astrand/xclip) or
[xsel](http://www.vergenet.net/~conrad/software/xsel/), so reprex can
access the X11 clipboard. This is 'nice to have', but not mandatory. The
usual `sudo apt-get install` or `sudo yum install` installation methods
should work for both xclip and xsel.

## Usage

Let’s say you copy this code onto your clipboard:

    (y <- 1:4)
    mean(y)

Then call `reprex()`, where the default target venue is GitHub:

``` r
reprex()
```

A nicely rendered HTML preview will display in RStudio's Viewer (if
you’re in RStudio) or your default browser otherwise.

The relevant bit of CommonMark Markdown is ready to be pasted from
your clipboard:

    ``` r
    (y <- 1:4)
    #> [1] 1 2 3 4
    mean(y)
    #> [1] 2.5
    ```

Here’s what that Markdown would look like rendered in a GitHub issue:

``` r
(y <- 1:4)
#> [1] 1 2 3 4
mean(y)
#> [1] 2.5
```

Anyone else can copy, paste, and run this immediately.

In addition to GitHub, this markdown also works on Stack Overflow and Discourse. Those venues can be formally requested via `venue = "so"` and `venue = "ds"`, but they are just aliases for `venue = "gh"`.

Instead of reading from the clipboard, you can:

  - `reprex(mean(rnorm(10)))` to get code from expression.

  - `reprex(input = "mean(rnorm(10))\n")` gets code from character
    vector (detected via length or terminating newline). Leading prompts
    are stripped from input source: `reprex(input = "> median(1:3)\n")`
    produces same output as `reprex(input = "median(1:3)\n")`

  - `reprex(input = "my_reprex.R")` gets code from file

  - Use one of the RStudio add-ins to use the selected text or current
    file.

But wait, there’s more\!

  - Get a runnable R script, augmented with commented output, with
    `reprex(..., venue = "R")`. This is useful for Slack, email, etc.

  - Get html with `reprex(..., venue = "html")`. Useful for sites that don't
    support markdown.

  - Prepare rendered, syntax-highlighted code snippets to paste into
    Keynote or PowerPoint, with `reprex(..., venue = "rtf")`. This
    feature is still experimental; see the [associated article](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/articles/rtf.html) for more.

  - By default, figures are uploaded to [imgur.com](http://imgur.com)
    and the resulting URL is dropped into an inline image tag.

  - Use the `outfile` argument to control where results are left behind.
    Use `outfile = NA` to work in current working directory.
    
  - Append session info via `reprex(..., session_info = TRUE)`.

  - Get clean, runnable code from wild-caught reprexes with
    
      - `reprex_invert()` = the opposite of `reprex()`
      - `reprex_clean()`, e.g. when you copy/paste from GitHub or Stack
        Overflow
      - `reprex_rescue()`, when you’re dealing with copy/paste from R
        Console
